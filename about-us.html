               <p>Welcome to the CALL OF DUTY WIKI – the ultimate starting point for anyone curious about Call of Duty: Black Ops 6.
We know diving into a new game can be overwhelming—especially one with as much depth, history, and action as the Black Ops series. That’s why we created this space: a friendly, easy-to-navigate hub where newcomers can get up to speed without feeling lost.

Here, you’ll find clear explanations, gameplay breakdowns, maps & modes overviews, and tips that make sense even if you’ve never played a Call of Duty game before. Whether you’re trying to understand the storyline, learn the difference between weapons, or figure out how multiplayer works, we’ve got you covered.

Our goal? To take you from “I’ve heard of Black Ops” to “I’m ready to jump into the fight” — all while keeping things fun, simple, and spoiler-smart. Think of us as your friendly squadmate guiding you through your first mission.

So gear up, soldier. Your Black Ops 6 journey starts here.</p>
