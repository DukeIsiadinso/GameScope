       <h1>Omnimovement (Core Innovation)</h1>

<p>This is the biggest mechanical shift in the game.
Unlike previous CODs where sprinting, sliding, or diving was directional (usually forward),<br>
<b>Omnimovement allows you to move fluidly in any direction.</b><br>

<p><b>‚Ä¢ Full 360¬∞ Mobility:</b> You can <b>sprint, dive, and slide sideways, backwards, or diagonally.</b><br>

<p><b>‚Ä¢ Combat Implications:</b><br>

‚Ä¢ Lets you dodge bullets in any direction (e.g., side-diving into cover instead of being stuck running forward).<br>

‚Ä¢ Gunfights feel less predictable because movement is no longer linear.<br>

‚Ä¢ Skilled players can chain moves‚Äîlike sprinting diagonally into a dive, then sliding backward while shooting.</p><br>

<P><b>‚Ä¢ Comparison to Past CODs:</b><br>
‚Ä¢ BO6‚Äôs system is more like Titanfall or Apex Legends fluidity, while still grounded in COD realism.</P><br>
    <p>___________________________________________________________________</p><Br>
<b>Core Movement Actions</b><br>

<p>BO6 combines classic COD mechanics with Omnimovement upgrades:<br>

<b>‚Ä¢ Sprint & Tactical Sprint</b><br>

    ‚Ä¢ Normal sprint: move faster, weapon lowered.<br>

    ‚Ä¢ Tac sprint: faster burst, but burns stamina quickly.<br>

<b>‚Ä¢ Slide</b><br>

    ‚Ä¢ Can now be done sideways, backward, or at an angle.<br>

    ‚Ä¢ Great for juking enemies or breaking aim assist.<br>

<b>‚Ä¢ Dive</b><br>

    ‚Ä¢ No longer just a forward dive ‚Üí omnidirectional.<br>

    ‚Ä¢ Can be used as an evasive escape (backwards dive out of danger).<br>

<b>‚Ä¢ Mantle / Climb</b><br>

    ‚Ä¢ Jumping onto ledges is smoother, less clunky.<br>

    ‚Ä¢ Can chain into Omnimovement (e.g., dive onto cover, mantle instantly).<br>

<p><b>‚Ä¢ Crouch / Prone</b><br></p>

    ‚Ä¢ Crouching auto-blends with Omnimovement ‚Üí dive directly into prone.<br>

    ‚Ä¢ Prone can be entered faster mid-gunfight.<br>

    <p>___________________________________________________________________</p><Br>

    <b>Intelligent Movement (Accessibility Layer)</b>

This is an optional system that automates some movement to help new players or streamline pro play:

‚Ä¢ Sprint Assist ‚Üí double-tap to always sprint without holding the stick.

‚Ä¢ Mantle Assist ‚Üí auto-climb when running into ledges (no button press).

‚Ä¢ Crouch Assist ‚Üí auto-crouch in low areas.<br>

üëâ These assists are toggles‚Äîyou can enable/disable based on preference. 
Competitive players may turn them off for precision.

 <b>Gunplay & Movement Synergy</b><br>

Movement isn‚Äôt just traversal‚Äîit directly affects shooting mechanics:<br>

<b>‚Ä¢ ADS While Sliding/Diving:</b><br>

    ‚Ä¢ You can <b>aim-down-sights (ADS) while moving,</b>b but accuracy penalty applies.<br>

    ‚Ä¢ Faster ADS speeds matter more with Omnimovement because players shoot from odd angles.<br>

<b>‚Ä¢ Hip-Fire Advantage:</b><br>

    ‚Ä¢ Aggressive SMG players can hip-fire while sliding sideways ‚Üí ‚Äúrun-and-gun‚Äù meta feels strong.<br>

<b>‚Ä¢ Stamina / Fatigue:</b><br>

    ‚Ä¢ Repeated dives/slides burn stamina, slowing recovery.<br>

    ‚Ä¢ Balances out spammy abuse of Omnimovement.<br>

<p>___________________________________________________________________</p><Br>

<b>Skill Expression</b><br>

Omnimovement creates a <b>skill ceiling:</b><br>

<b>‚Ä¢ Advanced Techniques:</b><br>

    <b>‚Ä¢ Directional Slide-Canceling:</b> cancel slide backward/sideways to reset gunfights.<br>

   <b>‚Ä¢ Strafe-Dive Combos:</b> peek a corner with ADS ‚Üí dive backward instantly while shooting.<br>

    <b>‚Ä¢ Cover Baiting:</b> dive behind cover, slide out at a diagonal, catch enemies tracking wrong.<br>

<b>‚Ä¢ Mind Games:</b> Players can fake movement patterns (e.g., dive left, slide right) to break tracking.<br>

<p>___________________________________________________________________</p><Br>

 <b>Impact on Game Modes</b><br>

    <b>‚Ä¢ Multiplayer:</b> Gunfights are way less predictable; movement mastery = survival.<br>

    <b>‚Ä¢ Zombies:</b> Backward diving is huge for kiting hordes.<br>

    <b>‚Ä¢ Campaign:</b> Missions designed with new movement paths, stealth/cinematic dives.<br>
