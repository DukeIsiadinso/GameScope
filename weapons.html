            <p><b>Categories & counts (launch)</b></p><br>

            <p><b>‚Ä¢ 33 weapons at launch</b> across Primaries (AR, SMG, Shotgun, LMG, Marksman, Sniper), Secondaries (Pistols, Launchers) and Melee. Example ARs shown in the launch blog include <B>XM4, AK-74, AMES 85, GPR 91, Model L, Goblin Mk2 (semi-auto), AS VAL (integral suppressor).</B></p><br>
            <p><b>Weapons & Loadouts</b></p><br>

            <b>‚Ä¢ Primary:</b> Up to six categories‚ÄîAssault Rifles, SMGs, LMGs, DMRs, Sniper Rifles, and Shotguns.<br>

            <b>‚Ä¢ Secondary:</b> Pistols or Launchers for backup and utility.<br>


            <b>‚Ä¢ Melee:</b> Tap for a quick weapon butt strike or hold to pull out your dedicated melee weapon.<br>


            <b>‚Ä¢ Gunsmith & Weapon Progression:</b> Weapons gain XP to unlock attachments. Higher-level customization affects recoil, handling, and effectiveness.<br>



            <b>‚Ä¢ Tactical & Lethal Equipment:</b> Includes drones, EMPs, grenades, deployables‚Äîstrategic tools beyond shooting.<br>



            <b>‚Ä¢ Field Upgrades:</b> Special abilities/items on cooldowns (e.g., intel or healing functions).<br>


            <b>‚Ä¢ Perks & Wildcards:</b> Choose from Specialty Perks (Enforcer, Strategist, Recon), and Wildcards like Overkill (two primaries) or Gunfighter (+8 attachments).<br>


            <b>‚Ä¢ Scorestreaks:</b> Three selectable streaks per match, powerful tools earned by performing well‚Äîbut reset on death.<br>


            <p><b>‚Ä¢ Gunsmith ‚Äì how it really works</b><br></p>

            <p><b>‚Ä¢ Attachment points:</b> Most guns get 5 attachment slots; pick any 5 of the eligible types. Equip the Gunfighter Wildcard to raise the cap to 8. (Launchers/Melee don‚Äôt take attachments.)<br>


            <b>‚Ä¢ Attachment types (11 total at launch):</b> Optic, Muzzle, Barrel, Underbarrel, Magazine, Rear Grip, Stock, Stock Pad, Comb (snipers), Laser, Fire Mods. Some weapons have exceptions (e.g., AS VAL has no Muzzle slot). <br>


            <b>‚Ä¢ What‚Äôs shared vs unique: Optics are shared within a weapon class</b> (unlock a red dot on one SMG ‚Üí it‚Äôs usable on all SMGs). All other attachment unlocks are per-weapon. <Br>


            <b>‚Ä¢ Clear stat model:</b> Guns show four big bars‚ÄîFirepower, Accuracy, Mobility, Handling‚Äîwith a detailed breakdown (reload quickness, bullet velocity, recoil gun kick, etc.) for fine comparison. Attachments are designed to give clear benefits (pros) rather than heavy trade-offs. <br>


            <b>‚Ä¢ Global Weapon Builds:</b> Create a build once and it syncs across Multiplayer, Round-Based Zombies, and Warzone (from S1 onward). Edit it in any mode; it updates everywhere. <br>


            <b>‚Ä¢ Firing Range:</b> Built-in moving target and recoil plate to test recoil patterns and damage falloff before you queue. <br></p>

            <p>__________________________________________________</p><br>
            <p><b>What each attachment family tends to do (practical)</b></p><br>

            <b>‚Ä¢ Muzzle: recoil shaping, suppression/flash control (where available).<br>

            <b>‚Ä¢ Barrel:</b> effective range, bullet velocity, recoil behavior.<br>

            <b>‚Ä¢ Underbarrel:</b> recoil/aiming stability while moving or sustained fire.<br>

            <b>‚Ä¢ Magazine:</b> mag size & reload times; sometimes movement/ADS hits.<br>

            <b>‚Ä¢ Rear Grip:</b> handling‚ÄîADS speed, sprint/slide/dive-to-fire timings (great with Omnimovement).<br>

            <b>‚Ä¢ Stock / Stock Pad:</b> strafe speed, gun kick control, aim stability.<br>

            <b>‚Ä¢ Laser:</b> hip-fire spread, sprint-to-fire, ADS responsiveness (mode-dependent visibility).<br>

            <b>‚Ä¢ Optic:</b> sight picture preference; minimal stat effect beyond ADS speed.<br>

            <b>‚Ä¢ Comb (snipers):</b> scope behavior and handling.<br>

            <b>‚Ä¢ Fire Mods:</b> alter fire behavior (e.g., burst/auto conversions on certain guns). Example: SVD Full-Auto Mod (event reward) flips the SVD to full auto with rebalanced recoil/damage and blocks some other slots. <br>

            <p>__________________________________________________</p><br>

            <p><b>Wildcards that change your build</b></p><br>

            <b>‚Ä¢ Overkill:</b> run two Primaries.<br>

            <b>‚Ä¢ Gunfighter:</b> +3 attachment points on your Primary (from 5 ‚Üí 8) once you reach Player Level 33. <br>

            <p>__________________________________________________</p><br>

            <p><b>Stats that matter (and how to read them)</b></p><br>

            <b>‚Ä¢ Firepower:</b> raw damage profile & multipliers at range.<br>

            <b>‚Ä¢ Accuracy:</b> recoil pattern/consistency, idle sway.<br>

            <b>‚Ä¢ Mobility:</b> sprint speed, strafe speed, movement with gun up.<br>

            <b>‚Ä¢ Handling: ADS speed, sprint/slide/dive-to-fire,</b> reload quickness.<br>
            Use the expanded view in Gunsmith to compare granular stats like velocity and gun kick before locking a build. <br>


            <p><b>Progression, unlocks & camos</b></p><br>

            <b>‚Ä¢ Weapon unlocks</b> tie to your Player Level (e.g., XM4 is available immediately; other ARs unlock at specific levels). The launch blog shows the full table.<br>

            <b>‚Ä¢ Camos:</b> Each weapon has a Military camo track, then Special camos tied to that weapon‚Äôs strengths (structure documented by Activision Support). Mastery systems and badges expand progression across modes. <br>

            <p>__________________________________________________</p><br>

            <p><b>Balancing & seasons (why meta shifts)</b></p>

            ‚Ä¢ Treyarch frequently tweaks attachments and recoil handling in seasonal patches (e.g., S04 buffed Short Barrel/foregrips/lasers; S05 fixed Gunsmith equip issues). Expect your favorite builds to change a bit over time. <br>

            <p>__________________________________________________</p><br>

            <p><b>‚Äústarter‚Äù builds by role (you can copy the logic to any gun)</b></p><br>

            <b>‚Ä¢ Balanced AR (e.g., XM4):</b> Muzzle (recoil), Barrel (range/velocity), Underbarrel (stability), Rear Grip (ADS/sprint-to-fire), Optic (preference). If you pop Gunfighter, add Stock (strafe control), Laser (handling), Magazine (reload QoL). 


            <b>‚Ä¢ High-mobility SMG:</b> Barrel (aim walking + velocity), Rear Grip (slide/dive-to-fire), Stock Pad (strafe), Laser (hip-fire), Magazine (bigger mags for multi-kills). Gunfighter slot 6‚Äì8: Underbarrel (recoil), Muzzle (flash/comp), Optic if irons are cluttered. <br>

            <b>‚Ä¢ Aggro DMR/Marksman:</b> Optic (clear mid-range), Barrel (velocity/range), Rear Grip (ADS), Stock (stability), Muzzle (recoil). Consider a Fire Mod if the weapon supports burst tuning that tightens time-to-kill when you‚Äôre accurate. <br>
