              <h2>Overview â€” how progression works</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>You earn XP across <strong>Multiplayer and Zombies</strong> to progress through the player levels (and, starting Season 01, Warzone counts toward this progression too).</li>
        <li>Progression unlocks weapons, equipment, scorestreaks, operators and more as you level.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>___________________________________________________________________</p><Br>

    <h2>Levels, Prestiges & the numbers</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Base level span:</strong> Level 1 â†’ 55 is the standard progression loop.</li>
        <li><strong>Prestige:</strong> Once you reach Level 55 you may choose to Prestige (itâ€™s a manual action). Each Prestige resets your player level but grants Prestige rewards and benefits.</li>
        <li><strong>Prestige tiers:</strong> There are 10 base Prestiges. After completing them you enter Prestige Master, at which point your level can climb beyond 55 up to Level 1,000.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>___________________________________________________________________</p><Br>

    <h2>What changes when you Prestige (reset vs keep)</h2>
    <h3>Resets / relocked on Prestige</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Your <strong>player level</strong> resets to Level 1 (Prestige 1) and all level unlocks (weapons, perks, equipment, etc.) are relocked until you re-earn them by leveling.</li>
        <li>Certain live stats (your current Elimination/Death record, etc.) are reset on every Prestige; lifetime career stats remain viewable in the Combat Record.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>___________________________________________________________________</p><Br>

    <h3>What you KEEP</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Weapon levels, weapon camos, challenge progress, weapon builds/customizations, and operator unlock progress</strong> persist. You wonâ€™t lose the XP/progress you already poured into a weapon or its camos.</li>
        <li><strong>Purchased / seasonal content</strong> (Battle Pass rewards, store bundles, event items) remains available and is not locked by Prestiging.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>___________________________________________________________________</p><Br>

    <h2>Permanent Unlocks â€” what they are & how to use them</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Each time you Prestige you receive a <strong>Permanent Unlock token</strong>. You can spend it to permanently unlock any single item (weapon, piece of equipment, etc.), so you donâ€™t have to relevel to that item after Prestiging.</li>
        <li><strong>Pro tip:</strong> use your Permanent Unlock on the weapon you play most (or an essential attachment/field upgrade) so you can jump back into your preferred playstyle immediately.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>___________________________________________________________________</p><Br>

    <h2>Prestige rewards & pacing</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Immediate and staggered rewards:</strong> You get an instant Permanent Unlock when you Prestige, then extra Prestige Rewards are handed out as you progress through that Prestigeâ€”generally every ten levels you earn cosmetic & novelty rewards (loading screens, emblems, GobbleGum packs in Zombies, animated emblems, charms, blueprints / operator skins, etc.).</li>
        <li><strong>Prestige Master / Legend rewards:</strong> Reaching Prestige Master unlocks a new reward track and further exclusive cosmetics; reaching Level 1,000 (the long grind beyond Prestige Master) can unlock special legend-tier rewards.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>___________________________________________________________________</p><Br>

    <h2>Weapon & item progression (how it ties into Prestige)</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Weapon XP & attachments:</strong> Weapons gain XP and unlock attachments and camos via usage. Certain attachment rules apply (e.g., optic attachments are shared across a weapon class while other attachments are per-weapon).</li>
        <li>Those weapon-level progressions are <strong>kept</strong> if you Prestige â€” youâ€™ll just need to relock/unlock the weapon itself by re-leveling unless you spend a Permanent Unlock.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>___________________________________________________________________</p><Br>

    <h2>Battle Pass & Seasons</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Battle Pass:</strong> Each Season has a Battle Pass (Pages/Tiers) with unlockable rewards. Battle Pass progression and items you claim are not removed by Prestige.</li>
        <li><strong>Seasonal XP mechanics:</strong> Progression includes cross-mode XP (Multiplayer, Zombies, Warzone) affecting your Battle Pass and player progressionâ€”so playing different modes can help your overall progress.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>___________________________________________________________________</p><Br>

    <h2>Good prestige strategy (short checklist)</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Finish any <strong>time-limited challenges</strong> you care about before you Prestige (event-only tasks wonâ€™t come back).</li>
        <li><strong>If you love a weapon</strong>, either:
            <ol>
                <li>Delay Prestiging until youâ€™ve unlocked the weapon and camos you want, or</li>
                <li>Prestige and immediately spend your Permanent Unlock on that weapon so itâ€™s usable without regrinding.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Remember: <strong>cosmetics / store / BP items</strong> are safe â€” they donâ€™t get locked by Prestige.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Quick FAQ</h2>
    <p><strong>Q â€” Will my camos/weapon progress be lost when I Prestige?</strong><br>
    A â€” No. Weapon levels, camos, and challenge progress persist; you only re-lock the ability to use those items until you re-unlock them at their level or spend a Permanent Unlock.</p>

    <p><strong>Q â€” How many Prestiges are there and whatâ€™s after Prestige 10?</strong><br>
    A â€” 10 base Prestiges; after that you reach Prestige Master and can level up to <strong>Level 1,000</strong> for further rewards.</p>

    <p><strong>Q â€” Are Battle Pass items safe when I Prestige?</strong><br>
    A â€” Yes. Items earned via Battle Pass, store bundles, and events remain permanently available.</p>
