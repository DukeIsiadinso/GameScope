                    ‚Ä¢ 16 total at launch<br>

                    <b>‚Ä¢ 12 Core Maps (6v6)</b><br>

                    <b>‚Ä¢ 4 Strike Maps</b> (playable in 2v2, 6v6, and sometimes as Gunfight arenas)<br>

                    ‚Ä¢ Design Philosophy

                    ‚Ä¢ Three-Lane Foundation: Like classic Treyarch maps ‚Üí left, middle, right lanes, but with extra flank routes.

                    ‚Ä¢ Verticality: Many maps include rooftops, balconies, or underground passages, forcing players to check multiple levels.

                    ‚Ä¢ Sightlines: Balanced between close-quarters (SMG/shotgun dominance) and long sightlines (snipers/ARs).

                    ‚Ä¢ Map Environments (Examples)

                    ‚Ä¢ (names & settings, based on official previews and leaks)

                    ‚Ä¢ Checkpoint ‚Äì Soviet border control facility; mix of tight indoor hallways and open vehicle yards.

                    ‚Ä¢ Red Zone ‚Äì Desert battlefield with open dunes and scattered ruins; strong for snipers.

                    ‚Ä¢ Skyline ‚Äì Rooftop apartment complex in an urban city; vertical gameplay with high flank potential.

                    ‚Ä¢ Radar Base ‚Äì Arctic environment with satellite dishes; one of the most open maps.

                    ‚Ä¢ Strip Mall ‚Äì American-style shopping center; mix of interior shops and parking lot fights.

                    ‚Ä¢ Apartments ‚Äì Dense living blocks; heavy emphasis on doorways, corners, and short engagements.

                    ‚Ä¢ Gameplay Flow

                    ‚Ä¢ Small Maps: Encourage constant action (Shotguns/SMGs thrive).

                    ‚Ä¢ Mid Maps: Balanced play; ARs rule but flanks possible.

                    ‚Ä¢ Large Maps: Best for objective play & long-range combat.

                    ‚Ä¢ Strike Maps: Designed for Gunfight (2v2) but scale to 6v6. These are usually smaller, arena-like maps.

                    ‚Ä¢ Map Rotation

                    ‚Ä¢ Dynamic Spawns: Treyarch tweaked spawn logic to prevent ‚Äúspawn traps.‚Äù

                    ‚Ä¢ Variety in Playlists: Smaller maps show up in faster game modes (TDM, KC), larger maps are pushed into objective playlists (Domination, Hardpoint).
